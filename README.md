## Natural Selection
Repo for experimenting with genetic algorithm simulations in Python

- Originally inspired from videos by [Primer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ)

### Built With

### Demo

**Description**
- Creatures with different gene based traits will explore and live their lives
- Creatures can eat and fight in the world
- If creatures do not eat enough they will perish
- If certain food requirements are met they will breed and have a chance to mutate and combine genes
- The creatures will evolve over many generations
- Survival of the fittest genome

**Genes**
- Speed: movement speed
- Vision: range of being able to see enemies and food
- Aggro: chance of attacking
- Health: health points
- Damage: damage points

**Todo**
- Create better gene combination/mutation methods
- Improve breeding mechanics
- Improve/fix movement/pathfinding methods
- Add combat mechanics
- Tweak numbers/balance the simulation to be more realistic
- Add some data visualizations
- Clean up code and optimize
