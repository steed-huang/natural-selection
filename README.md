## Natural Selection
Repo for experimenting with genetic algorithms in Python

**Description**
* Creatures with different gene based traits will explore and live their lives
* Creatures can eat and fight in the world
* If creatures do not eat enough they will perish
* If certain food requirements are met they will breed and have a chance to mutate and combine genes
* The creatures will evolve over many generations
* Survival of the fittest genome

**Planned Genes**
* Speed: movement speed
* Vision: range of being able to see enemies and food
* Aggro: chance of attacking
* Health: health points
* Damage: damage points

**Todo**
* Add cost to higher/better stats (go hungry faster)
* Create better gene combination/mutation methods
* Improve breeding mechanics
* Add combat mechanics
* Tweak numbers/balance the simulation to be more realistic
* Add some data visualizations
* Clean up code and optimize
